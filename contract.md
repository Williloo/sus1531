1. Meeting Schedule:
When: Sundays, 11am-12pm
Platform: MS Teams
Standups:ls
Each member will participate in 3 standups per week -  Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
One member will initiate a post on MS Teams, and the others will reply to that post.

2. Meeting Minutes:
Meeting minutes will be recorded and stored in the GitLab Wiki.
Meeting minutes recorder: William Liu.
MS Teams meetings will also be transcribed.

3. Communication Platform:
The primary platform for team communication will be MS Teams.

4. Response Time:
Team members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours.
All members will have MS Teams installed on their phones with notifications enabled.
For urgent matters, ping the required users and respond within 6 hours.

5. Handling Conflicts:
Conflicts will be resolved by a majority vote.
We will use issue boards to track and discuss differing opinions.
If a significant issue cannot be resolved internally, we will seek assistance from our tutor.

6. Steps if a Team Member Gets Stuck:
Attempt to resolve the issue independently using resources like Google and W3Schools.
If the issue persists, follow the chain of demand for assistance: Eric → Josh → Yash → William → Susie (ask person to your right in the chain).
Avoid the use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) and prioritise seeking help from team members.

7. Preventing Last-Minute Issues:
Reasonable internal deadlines will be set:
For iterations, work should be completed two days prior to the actual deadline.
For the final project, work should be completed one week before the actual deadline, including test cases.
Regular standups will help monitor progress and prevent last-minute problems.
Check on other members to make sure no one is stuck in order to stay on track.
